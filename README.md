# mePlane
we propose a method to solve that limitation.By designing an
application program, which we called mePlane which supports users to use the HTC cell phone and play the music. Meanwhile listeners could score the emotions of the
song. In keeping with the Thayerâ€™s arousal-valence emotion model, we have designed a user interface on a 2-dimension plane. Finally, there will be a lot of points
available to represent song mapping in this 2-dimension plane. When users touch the plane, it will show the changed playlists for users at the same time.
